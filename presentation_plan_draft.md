## Context / Scenario (100 words)

As the founder and CEO of CloudConnect AI, I am presenting to a panel of venture capital investors at the Hong Kong Tech Innovation Summit 2025. The presentation aims to secure HK$1 million in seed funding to scale our AI-powered omnichannel contact center platform. The investor panel consists of five partners from leading VC firms specializing in SaaS and AI technologies, with particular interest in enterprise solutions. The competitive landscape shows traditional contact centers struggling with fragmented systems, high operational costs, and poor customer satisfaction. Our solution addresses these pain points through unified AI-driven voice, chat, and video capabilities with ultra-low latency and seamless integration.

The investment will enable product development, market expansion, and team growth, positioning us as the leading AI contact center solution provider in Asia-Pacific.
